`basic-crud` - Contains only the CRUD operation without any Authentication.

`basic-crud-auth` - Contains the CRUD operation with basic Authentication.

## Learning Roadmap
### `basic-crud` Branch
1. First of all, start by importing the database file `basic_crud.sql` in your database.
2. Then, review the database connection logic in `database.php`.
3. Review the `index.php` file to understand the folder structure and CRUD operation.
4. Work your way through the `create-product.php`, `edit-product.php`, and `delete-product.php` files.

### `basic-crud-auth` Branch
1. First, go through the registration logic in `register.php`.
2. Then, review the login logic in `login.php`.
3. Again go through step 1 and 2 as there are lots of logic and codes to understand.
4. Go through the `index.php` file to see how the sessions can be implemented in the application.
5. Visit the `logout.php` file to understand how to destroy the session.
6. Work your way through the `create-product.php`, `edit-product.php`, and `delete-product.php` files to understand how the authentication and session data can be implemented in different pages.
